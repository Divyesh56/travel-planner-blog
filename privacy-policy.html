            <p>This Privacy Policy describes how [Cheaptrip] collects, uses, and discloses information when you use our printable travel itinerary tool and associated website (the "Tool"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and handling your data in an open and transparent manner.</p>

            <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
            <p>As a static website primarily offering a tool for generating printable content, we aim to collect minimal personal data. However, some information may be collected automatically or if you choose to provide it:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Information You Provide:</strong> We do not require account creation or direct personal information (like names or email addresses) to use the core functionality of our Tool. If you choose to contact us via email, we will collect your email address and any information you provide in your message to respond to your inquiry.</li>
                <li><strong>Automatically Collected Information (Usage Data):</strong> When you access the Tool, our hosting provider (e.g., GitHub Pages) and any analytics services we use (e.g., Google Analytics) may automatically collect certain information:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>IP Address:</strong> Your Internet Protocol (IP) address.</li>
                        <li><strong>Browser Type & Operating System:</strong> Information about your web browser and device.</li>
                        <li><strong>Referral Source:</strong> The website you came from to reach our Tool.</li>
                        <li><strong>Pages Viewed:</strong> Which pages you visit on our Tool and how long you spend on them.</li>
                        <li><strong>Interaction Data:</strong> Non-personally identifiable information about how you interact with the Tool (e.g., buttons clicked, features used).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mt-4">
                <em>Note: We do not store any personal data you might input into the itinerary fields themselves (like names, addresses, or specific travel plans) on our servers. All processing for generating the printable output happens client-side in your browser.</em>
            </p>

            <h3>2. How We Use Your Information</h3>
            <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To provide, operate, and maintain our Tool.</li>
                <li>To understand and analyze how you use our Tool, and to improve its functionality and user experience.</li>
                <li>To respond to your inquiries and provide customer support.</li>
                <li>To detect, prevent, and address technical issues or potential security threats.</li>
                <li>For internal analytics and research purposes (e.g., to see which features are most popular).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. How We Share Your Information</h3>
            <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information to outside parties. We may share non-personally identifiable usage data with third-party service providers for the purposes of analytics and website improvement. These third parties are obligated to keep your information confidential and use it only for the purposes for which we disclose it to them.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hosting Provider:</strong> Our website is hosted on GitHub Pages, which collects certain data (like IP addresses) for security and operational purposes. Please refer to <a href="https://docs.github.com/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement" target="_blank" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">GitHub's Privacy Statement</a> for more details on their data handling practices.</li>
                <li><strong>Analytics Services:</strong> We may use services like Google Analytics to understand website traffic and usage patterns. Google Analytics collects data anonymously and does not identify individual users. You can learn more about Google's privacy practices and how to opt-out by visiting the <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on</a>.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. Data Security</h3>
            <p>We implement reasonable security measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

            <h3>5. Your Data Protection Rights</h3>
            <p>Depending on your location and applicable laws (e.g., GDPR), you may have the following rights regarding your personal data:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The right to access:</strong> You have the right to request copies of your personal data.</li>
                <li><strong>The right to rectification:</strong> You have the right to request that we correct any information you believe is inaccurate or complete information you believe is incomplete.</li>
                <li><strong>The right to erasure:</strong> You have the right to request that we erase your personal data, under certain conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>The right to restrict processing:</strong> You have the right to request that we restrict the processing of your personal data, under certain conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>The right to object to processing:</strong> You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data, under certain conditions.</li>

            <h3>6. Third-Party Links</h3>
            <p>Our Tool may contain links to other websites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.</p>

            <h3>7. Cookies</h3>
            <p>Our Tool may use "cookies" to enhance user experience. These are small files placed on your device. For example, Google Analytics uses cookies to collect anonymous data about website usage. You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, if you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of our Tool.</p>

            <h3>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
            <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.
